# Virtual-handbag-try-on
Use Body Scanner scan 30 females Between 20 and 30. Use these 3d body data to train a parametric system. This system can use few measure 
data to create a similar 3d body model. Use this model as occlusion object to prove augmented reality application occlusion quality.
Use kinect v2 capture skeleton position in world space coordinate. Put 3d bags model on customer's arm. Create a virtual handbag try-on 
system and it can operate in real-time;
